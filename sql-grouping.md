This document provides a concise and professional reference to commonly used SQL aggregate, string, and date/time functions, along with syntax examples. It is suitable for learning, interviews, or quick lookup during development.

üìä Aggregate Functions
Aggregate functions perform calculations on multiple rows and return a single value.

Function	Description	Example
SUM()	Calculates the total sum	SELECT SUM(amount) FROM payment;

FROM customers;
üîó Concatenation
SQLite uses || to concatenate strings.

sql
Copy
